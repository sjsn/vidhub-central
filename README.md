# VidHub Central
This is the repo for my final project for Info344 - Server Side Web Developement. The purpose of this assignment is to create and deploy a fully functional web app.

## The project
## Purpose
VidHub Central is a video/live-stream service that allows people to link their YouTube and Twitch.tv accounts and see the most recent videos/live-streams they haven't watched yet. Users can also favorite content creators to get easier access to their content as well as organize creators into categories to make it easier to find them later.

The whole point is to make it so users don't have to go to and navigate multiple sites just to keep up with their video watching services.

### Technical
This app was developed using the MEAN stack and deployed on an AWS instance running ubuntu.
